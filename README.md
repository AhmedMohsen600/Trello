# Trello Clone

Trello is a Trello-like web application built using Next.js, TypeScript, React Beautiful DnD for drag and drop functionality, and Zustand as state management. It provides a simple and intuitive interface for managing tasks with three columns: Todo, In Progress, and Done. Users can easily drag and drop columns and todos to organize their tasks efficiently.
